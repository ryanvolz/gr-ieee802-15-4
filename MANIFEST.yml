description: |-
  This is an IEEE802.15.4 transceiver for GNU Radio. It is based on the UCLA implementation (https://cgran.org/wiki/UCLAZigBee) of Thomas Schmid.

  Currently, it features the following:

  - The O-QPSK PHY encapsulated in a hierarchical block.
  - The CSS PHY, also encapsulated in a hierarchical block (Limitation: Packets need to have a fixed length).
  - A block that implements the Rime communication stack. Rime is a lightweight communication stack designed for Wireless Sensor Networks and is part of the Contiki Operating System.
  - A transceiver flow graph with USRP <-> PHY <-> MAC <-> Network layer (Rime) <-> UDP Socket / APP which resembles pretty well the ISO/OSI structure.
  - A sample application which visualizes sensor values. The application shows how easy it is to connect an external program to the flow graph by using Socket PDU blocks.
  - An IEEE 802.15.4 and Rime dissector for Wireshark.

  Some interesting stuff:

  - Packets can be piped to Wireshark.
  - The complete physical modulation is done with plain GNU Radio blocks.
  - It is interoperable with TelosB sensor motes.
  - It is interoperable with Contiki.
  - It uses a block to tag packet bursts with tx_sob and tx_eob tags. This tags are understood by the UHD blocks and allow fast switching between transmission and reception.
